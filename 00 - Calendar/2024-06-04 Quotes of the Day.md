 >$^{31}$ Godel’s theorem proves that no metaphor can ever be sufficient, as complete systems have undecidability, and decidable systems are incomplete. A large part of education should be helping people understand this and teaching them how to give up invalid metaphors when they no longer work. 

>$^{32}$ One of my favorite improper use of metaphors is to ask, “What color is faith?”. The obvious answer is yellow, as the Christian Bible describes faith as being “as a mustard seed’, and mustard seeds are yellow. This is obvious non- sense, but I personally encounter this type of reasoning many times every day.

>$^{33}$ Not to make too fine a point here, but this is true in all things in life. We all have prejudices and biases, all of them based on some facts and lots of unexamined metaphors of life we have created. Part of education, and of creating an educated populace, is to teach people to examine their assumptions about their metaphors.
