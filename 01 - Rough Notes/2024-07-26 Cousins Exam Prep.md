## Ideal Questions (5 marks per item of the ideal questions) 


#### (1) What are the advantages and disadvantages account receivables to a firm?
---
> **Accounts receivable** represent amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.
 
Advantages:

- Increased sales: Offering credit terms can attract customers and increase sales.
- Improved cash flow: While not immediate, accounts receivable contribute to overall cash flow.
* Competitive advantage: Credit terms can give a company a competitive edge.


Disadvantages:

- Credit risk: There's a risk of customers defaulting on their payments.
* Tied-up capital: Money invested in accounts receivable is unavailable for other uses.
- Administrative costs: Managing accounts receivable requires time and resources.
- Potential for bad debts: Some customers may not pay, resulting in losses.
 

#### (2) What are the differences between Allowance Method and Direct Write-off Method for uncollectible account receivable? 
---
> Both methods account for uncollectible accounts, but they differ in timing and approach.
 

**Allowance Method:**

- **Matching principle:** Expenses (bad debts) are matched with related revenues.
- **Estimate of uncollectible accounts:** A company estimates the amount of bad debts and creates an allowance for doubtful accounts.
- **Matching principle:** Better reflects the true income of the period.
- **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant.**

**Direct Write-Off Method:**

- **No allowance:** Bad debts are only recorded when a specific account is deemed uncollectible.
- **Mismatching of revenue and expenses:** Violates the matching principle.
- **Overstates assets:** Accounts receivable are overstated until written off.
- **Generally not accepted under GAAP.**



#### (3) What is the definition of a plant asset? What is different type of plant assets? How different between a plant asset and a current asset?
---
> A **plant asset** (or fixed asset) is a long-term asset with a physical form that is used in the operations of a business and is not intended for sale.

**Types of plant assets:**

- **Land:** The earth's surface and anything permanently attached to it.
- **Buildings:** Structures used for business operations.
- **Equipment:** Machinery, furniture, and other assets used in operations.
- **Vehicles:** Cars, trucks, and other transportation assets.

**Difference between plant and current assets:**

- **Plant assets:** Have a long useful life, are not readily converted to cash, and are used in operations.
- **Current assets:** Expected to be converted to cash within one year, are more liquid.


#### (4) How to allocate cost of a plant asset into an expense? Give your explanations to each method of the cost allocation of a plant asset. 
---
 > Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a plant asset over its useful life.

**Methods of depreciation:**

- **Straight-line method:** Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.


- **Units-of-production method:** Allocates depreciation based on the asset's usage.
    - (Cost - Salvage value) / Total estimated units of production = Depreciation per unit
- **Declining-balance method:** Allocates a higher amount of depreciation in the early years and lower amounts in later years.
    - (Book value at beginning of year) x Depreciation rate = Depreciation expense

**Choice of method:** Depends on factors like asset usage, company policy, and tax implications.


 
 **Methods of depreciation:**
 
	- ***Straight-line method***:
			Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.

$$

				{\text{Useful Life}} = \text{Annual Depreciation}
	}
