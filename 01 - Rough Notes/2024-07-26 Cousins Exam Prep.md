**Allowance Method:**

**Direct Write-Off Method:**

### (4) How to allocate cost of a plant asset into an expense? Give your explanations to each method of the cost allocation of a plant asset. 
---
 > Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a plant asset over its useful life.

**Methods of depreciation:**

- **Straight-line method:** Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Useful Life}} = \text{Annual Depreciation}
	}
$$

- **Units-of-production method:** Allocates depreciation based on the asset's usage.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Total Estimated Units of Production}} = \text{Depreciation per Unit}
	}
$$

- **Declining-balance method:** Allocates a higher amount of depreciation in the early years and lower amounts in later years.
$$
	\large{
		\text{Book value at beginning of year} \times \text{Depreciation rate} = \text{Depreciation expense}
	}
$$

**Choice of method:** Depends on factors like asset usage, company policy, and tax implications.
