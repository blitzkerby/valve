> **Accounts receivable** represent amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.

### (2) What are the differences between Allowance Method and Direct Write-off Method for uncollectible account receivable? 
---

> Both methods account for uncollectible accounts, but they differ in timing and approach.
 

**Allowance Method:**

- **Matching principle:** Expenses (bad debts) are matched with related revenues.
- **Estimate of uncollectible accounts:** A company estimates the amount of bad debts and creates an allowance for doubtful accounts.
- **Matching principle:** Better reflects the true income of the period.
- **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant.**

**Direct Write-Off Method:**

- **No allowance:** Bad debts are only recorded when a specific account is deemed uncollectible.
- **Mismatching of revenue and expenses:** Violates the matching principle.
- **Overstates assets:** Accounts receivable are overstated until written off.
- **Generally not accepted under GAAP.**









### (3) What is the definition of a plant asset? What is different type of plant assets? How different between a plant asset and a current asset?

### (4) How to allocate cost of a plant asset into an expense? Give your explanations to each method of the cost allocation of a plant asset. 
---
 
 > Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a plant asset over its useful life.

**Methods of depreciation:**

- **Straight-line method:** Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Useful Life}} = \text{Annual Depreciation}
	}
$$

- **Units-of-production method:** Allocates depreciation based on the asset's usage.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Total Estimated Units of Production}} = \text{Depreciation per Unit}
	}
$$

- **Declining-balance method:** Allocates a higher amount of depreciation in the early years and lower amounts in later years.
$$
	\large{
		\text{Book value at beginning of year} \times \text{Depreciation rate} = \text{Depreciation expense}
	}
$$

**Choice of method:** Depends on factors like asset usage, company policy, and tax implications.

## II. Problems (10 marks per item of the problems)




### Problem 1

Gomez Corp. uses the allowance method to account for un-collectibles. On January 31, it wrote off an $800 account of a customer, C. Green. On March 9, it receives a $300 payment from Green. 
   
	1) Prepare the journal entry or entries for January 31. 
	2) Prepare the journal entry or entries for March 9; assume no additional money is expected from Green. 

---

### 1. January 31: Writing Off C. Green's Account

Since Gomez Corp. uses the allowance method, we will reduce the Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

- **Debit:** Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($800)
- **Credit:** Accounts Receivable ($800)

**Journal Entry:**

| Date   | Account Title                   | Debit | Credit |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Jan 31 | Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 800   |        |
|        | Accounts Receivable - C. Green  |       | 800    |


### 2. March 9: Receiving Payment from C. Green

The customer made a partial payment. This will increase Cash and decrease Accounts Receivable. However, since we previously wrote off the entire amount, we need to reinstate the account and then record the cash receipt.

**First Entry: Reinstating the Account**

- **Debit:** Accounts Receivable - C. Green ($800)
- **Credit:** Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($800)

**Second Entry: Recording Cash Receipt**

- **Debit:** Cash ($300)
- **Credit:** Accounts Receivable - C. Green ($300)

**Journal Entries:**

|Date|Account Title|Debit|Credit|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mar 9|Accounts Receivable - C. Green|800||
||Allowance for Doubtful Accounts||800|
|Mar 9|Cash|300||
||Accounts Receivable - C. Green||300|


**Note:** The remaining balance of $500 in Accounts Receivable - C. Green would typically be considered uncollectible and written off again at a later date if no further payments are received.
