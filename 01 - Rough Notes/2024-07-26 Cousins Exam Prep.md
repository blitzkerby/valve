> **Accounts receivable** represent amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.

#### (2) What are the differences between Allowance Method and Direct Write-off Method for uncollectible account receivable? 
---
> Both methods account for uncollectible accounts, but they differ in timing and approach.
 

**Allowance Method:**

- **Matching principle:** Expenses (bad debts) are matched with related revenues.
- **Estimate of uncollectible accounts:** A company estimates the amount of bad debts and creates an allowance for doubtful accounts.
- **Matching principle:** Better reflects the true income of the period.
- **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant.**

**Direct Write-Off Method:**

- **No allowance:** Bad debts are only recorded when a specific account is deemed uncollectible.
- **Mismatching of revenue and expenses:** Violates the matching principle.
- **Overstates assets:** Accounts receivable are overstated until written off.
- **Generally not accepted under GAAP.**









#### (3) What is the definition of a plant asset? What is different type of plant assets? How different between a plant asset and a current asset?
---
> A **plant asset** (or fixed asset) is a long-term asset with a physical form that is used in the operations of a business and is not intended for sale.

**Types of plant assets:**

- **Land:** The earth's surface and anything permanently attached to it.
- **Buildings:** Structures used for business operations.
- **Equipment:** Machinery, furniture, and other assets used in operations.
- **Vehicles:** Cars, trucks, and other transportation assets.

**Difference between plant and current assets:**

- **Plant assets:** Have a long useful life, are not readily converted to cash, and are used in operations.
- **Current assets:** Expected to be converted to cash within one year, are more liquid.









#### (4) How to allocate cost of a plant asset into an expense? Give your explanations to each method of the cost allocation of a plant asset. 
---
 > Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a plant asset over its useful life.

**Methods of depreciation:**

- **Straight-line method:** Allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense each year.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Useful Life}} = \text{Annual Depreciation}
	}
$$

- **Units-of-production method:** Allocates depreciation based on the asset's usage.
$$
	\large{
		\frac{\text{Cost}-\text{Salvage Value}}
				{\text{Total Estimated Units of Production}} = \text{Depreciation per Unit}
	}
$$

- **Declining-balance method:** Allocates a higher amount of depreciation in the early years and lower amounts in later years.
$$
	\large{
		\text{Book value at beginning of year} \times \text{Depreciation rate} = \text{Depreciation expense}
	}
$$

**Choice of method:** Depends on factors like asset usage, company policy, and tax implications.
