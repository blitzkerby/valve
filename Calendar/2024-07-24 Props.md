## Props

>
	Props are used to pass data from *parent components* to *child components* 
> 	
> 	(down the components tree)
> 	


> 
	Essential tool to configure and customize components 
> 
> 	(like function parameters)
> 	



> 
	With props, parent components control how child components look and work
> 


> 
	**Anything** can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components
> 


```jsx
function CourseRating()
{
	const [rating, setRating] = useState(0);

	return (
		<Rating 
			text="Course Rating"
			currentRating={Rating}
			numOptions={3}
			options={["Terrible", "Okay", "Amazing"]}
			allRatings={{num:2390, avg:4.8}}
			setRating={setRating}
			component={Star}
		/>			
	)
}

```

Props is data coming from the ***outside***, and can only be updated by the ***parent component***.

![Props are read-only, they are immutable! This is one of Reactâ€™s strict rules]
![If you need to mutate props, you actually need state]
