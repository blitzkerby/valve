### Where to create *side effects* 
---
We need side effects all the time. They make our applications do something ![not] in render logic!


Side effects can be made in:

- Event handlers
	Triggered by events: `onClick`, `onSubmit`, etcâ€¦

- `useEffect`
	Effects allow us to write code that will run at different moments: mount, re-render, or unmount
